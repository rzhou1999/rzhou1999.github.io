<p class="tab-desc-noimg">
  Hi there! I am a programmer studying at Cornell University. My primary interests involve lower level/systems-focused programming,
  but I often make forays into higher level programming and front-end development as well (this website is the result of one of them!).
  Some of my favorite classes/topics so far have been CS 3410 Computer System Organization and Programming, CS 4410 Operating Systems, and CS 4420 Computer Architecture.
  <br><br>
  I graduated from Commonwealth High School of Boston in 2017. I am currently a second year university student majoring in CS and minoring in China and Asia Pacific Studies.
  <br><br>
  In September 2018, I joined the Cornell Hyperloop project team as a member of the electrical software subteam. As of Spring 2019, I will also be a
  teaching assistant for Cornell's CS 3410 Computer System Organization and Programming course.

  When I'm not in front of a computer screen (which, admittedly, isn't too often), I enjoy choral singing. I sing bass, and am currently a member of the Cornell Chorale.
